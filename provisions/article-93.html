    <h1>Article 93 - POST-MARKET MONITORING, INFORMATION SHARING AND MARKET SURVEILLANCE - Power to request measures</h1>
    <p>



1.   Where necessary and appropriate, the Commission may request providers to:
(a)	take appropriate measures to comply with the obligations set out in Articles 53 and 54;
(b)	implement mitigation measures, where the evaluation carried out in accordance with Article 92 has given rise to serious and substantiated concern of a systemic risk at Union level;
(c)	restrict the making available on the market, withdraw or recall the model.
2.   Before a measure is requested, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general-purpose AI model.
3.   If, during the structured dialogue referred to in paragraph 2, the provider of the general-purpose AI model with systemic risk offers commitments to implement mitigation measures to address a systemic risk at Union level, the Commission may, by decision, make those commitments binding and declare that there are no further grounds for action.
