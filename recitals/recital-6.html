    <h1>Recital 6</h1>
    <p>Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for AI and its regulatory framework 
      to be developed in accordance with Union values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), 
      the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the Charter. 
      As a prerequisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, 
      with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.</p>
