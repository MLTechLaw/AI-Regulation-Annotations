    <h1>Recital 3</h1>
    <p>AI systems can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and many parts of society, 
      including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules 
      to ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with fundamental rights obligations. 
      Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, 
      import or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, 
      while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market 
      should be prevented by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest 
      and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). 
      To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions 
      of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons 
      for the purpose of law enforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, 
      in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, 
      it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.</p>
