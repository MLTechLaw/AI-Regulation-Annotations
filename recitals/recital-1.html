    <h1>Recital 1</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down 
      a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, the placing on the market, the putting into service 
      and the use of artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, 
      to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring a high level of protection 
      of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), 
      including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, 
      and to support innovation. This Regulation ensures the free movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services, 
      thus preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorised 
      by this Regulation.</p>
