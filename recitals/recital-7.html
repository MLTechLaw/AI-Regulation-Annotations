    <h1>     Recital 7    </h1>
    <p> 
        
        In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, 
        safety and fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be established. 
        Those rules should be consistent with the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the 
        Unionâ€™s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European Declaration 
        on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI 
        of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).
