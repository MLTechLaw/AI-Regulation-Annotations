    <h1>Recital 4</h1>
    <p>AI is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, environmental and societal benefits 
      across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, 
      and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings 
      and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, 
      infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, 
      resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
