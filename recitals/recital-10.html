    <h1>     Recital 10    </h1>
    <p>

The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (11) and (EU) 2018/1725 (12) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by way of providing conditions for any storing of personal and non-personal data in, and access from, terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where data sets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with those instruments. It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their role as data controllers or processors stemming from Union or national law on the protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjectsâ€™ rights and other remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights.
